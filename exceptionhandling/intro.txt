Syntax Error:
As the name suggest this error is caused by wrong syntax in the code.
It leads to the termination of the program.

Exceptions:
Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct but the
code resulted in an error. This error does not stop the execution of the program,
however, it changes the normal flow of the program.
Note: Exception is the base class for all the exceptions in Python.

Else Clause:
In python, you can also use else clause on the try-except block which must be present
after all the except clauses. The code enters the else block only if the try clause
does not raise an exception.

Finally Keyword in Python:
Python provides a keyword finally, which is always executed after try and except blocks.
The finally block always executes after normal termination of try block or after try
block terminates due to some exception.

"""
Although you could manually perform such operations
on a list (e.g., appending, deleting, etc.), the
queue solution is far more elegant and runs a lot
faster.

A deque can be used whenever you need a simple
queue structure. If you donâ€™t give it a maximum size,
you get an unbounded queue that lets you append
and pop items on either end.
A deque is also Heterogenous.

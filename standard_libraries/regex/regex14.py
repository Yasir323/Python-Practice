Say you want to censor the names of the secret agents by
showing just the first letters of their names. To do this, you could use the
regex Agent (\w)\w* and pass r'\1****' as the first argument to sub(). The \1
in that string will be replaced by whatever text was matched by group 1â€”
that is, the (\w) group of the regular expression.

print(agentNamesRegex.sub(r'\1****', 'Agent Alice told Agent Carol that Agent \
Eve knew Agent Bob was a double agent.'))

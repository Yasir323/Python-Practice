'''
In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the
child class that have the same name as the methods in
the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits
the methods from the parent class. However, it is possible
to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited
from the parent class. This is particularly useful in cases
where the method inherited from the parent class doesnâ€™t quite
fit the child class. In such cases, we re-implement the
method in the child class. This process of re-implementing a
method in the child class is known as Method Overriding.
